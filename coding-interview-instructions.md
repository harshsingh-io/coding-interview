# Coding Interview Problem-Solving Framework

## 1. Initial Problem Assessment (2-3 minutes)
- Listen carefully and take notes
- Restate the problem to confirm understanding
- Ask clarifying questions about:
  - Input format and constraints
  - Output requirements
  - Edge cases and special conditions
  - Scale of the problem (data size)
  - Any assumptions you can make

## 2. Requirements Clarification Checklist
Ask about:
- Input validation requirements
- Data types (int/float/string)
- Range of values (negative/positive)
- Handling of duplicates
- Memory constraints
- Empty/null input handling
- Error handling expectations
- Performance requirements

## 3. Solution Development Process (5-7 minutes)
1. Start with a simple example
2. Draw/write example cases including:
   - Normal case
   - Edge cases
   - Empty/minimal input
   - Large input
3. Think out loud while:
   - Explaining your thought process
   - Discussing potential approaches
   - Analyzing tradeoffs
4. Start with brute force solution
5. Look for optimization opportunities:
   - Can sorting help?
   - Would a hash table be useful?
   - Is there a two-pointer approach?
   - Can we use binary search?

## 4. Before Coding (2-3 minutes)
- Explain your chosen approach
- Discuss time and space complexity
- Get interviewer's feedback
- Outline your code structure
- Discuss any helper functions needed

## 5. Coding Phase (15-20 minutes)
- Write clean, well-structured code
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add brief comments for clarity
- Handle edge cases
- Keep talking through your implementation
- Consider modularity and reusability

## 6. Testing Strategy (5-7 minutes)
1. Start with small test cases
2. Test edge cases:
   - Empty input
   - Single element
   - Duplicate elements
   - Boundary values
3. Walk through code with example
4. Look for off-by-one errors
5. Consider error cases

## 7. Optimization Discussion (3-5 minutes)
- Analyze current solution's limitations
- Discuss scaling considerations:
  - Memory usage
  - Processing time
  - Distributed processing options
- Suggest improvements
- Discuss tradeoffs

## Common Optimization Patterns to Consider
1. Hash Tables: O(1) lookup
2. Two Pointers: Linear traversal
3. Sliding Window: Substring/subarray problems
4. Binary Search: Sorted data
5. Dynamic Programming: Overlapping subproblems
6. Divide and Conquer: Breaking into smaller problems

## Communication Best Practices
- Maintain constant verbal communication
- Explain your reasoning
- Ask for feedback
- Be receptive to hints
- Acknowledge and build on interviewer's suggestions
- Express your thoughts on tradeoffs
- Admit if you don't know something

## Red Flags to Avoid
- Jumping into coding without clarification
- Staying silent for long periods
- Ignoring interviewer feedback
- Skipping edge cases
- Writing messy, unstructured code
- Making assumptions without validating
- Giving up too quickly on problems

Remember: The interview is not just about getting the right answerâ€”it's about demonstrating your problem-solving process, communication skills, and engineering mindset.

This framework should help you approach coding interview problems systematically and showcase your abilities effectively. Practice applying this framework to different types of problems to make it second nature during actual interviews.
