For Each Pattern, Remember to:
1. Identify the pattern trigger (what suggests using this pattern)
2. Understand the common variations
3. Know the time/space complexity
4. Practice multiple problems of each type
5. Learn common pitfalls and edge cases
6. Understand when to combine multiple patterns

Practice Tips:
- Start with easier problems for each pattern
- Progress to medium and hard variations
- Time yourself solving problems
- Practice explaining your approach
- Focus on edge cases
- Learn to recognize pattern combinations
- Review and optimize your solutions

Remember: The key to mastering these patterns is not just memorization, but understanding why and when to apply them. Practice recognizing which pattern(s) fit a given problem and how to adapt them to different scenarios.
